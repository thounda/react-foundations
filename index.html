    To use React in your newly created project, load two React scripts from an external website called unpkg.com:

* react is the core React library.
* react-dom provides DOM-specific methods that enable you to use React with the DOM.
    -->
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>

    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>

    <!--
Instead of directly manipulating the DOM with plain JavaScript, remove the DOM methods that you had added previously, and add the ReactDOM.createRoot() method to target a specific DOM element and create a root to display your React Components in. Then, add the root.render() method to render your React code to the DOM.

This will tell React to render our <h1> title inside our #app element.
-->

    <!-- Babel Script

    In addition, you will need to inform Babel what code to transform by changing the script type to type=text/jsx. 
    -->
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone/babel.min.js"></script>
    <script type="text/jsx">


      const app = document.getElementById("app");
      const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(app);
      root.render(<h1>Develop. Preview. Ship.</h1>);
    </script>

Comparing the declarative React code written in branch 'ch03' (imperative code) vs this branch 'ch04' - you can start to see how using React enables you to cut down a lot of repetitive code.

And this is exactly what React does, it's a library that contains reusable snippets of code that perform tasks on your behalf - in this case, updating the UI.

Essential JavaScript for React

While you can learn JavaScript and React at the same time, being familiar with JavaScript can make the process of learning React easier.

In the next set of code examples, you will be introduced to some core concepts of React from a JavaScript perspective. 

Here's a summary of the JavaScript topics that will be mentioned:

- Functions and Arrow Functions
- Objects
- Arrays and array methods
- Destructuring
- Template literals
- Ternary Operators
- ES Modules and Import / Export Syntax

While this course does not dive into JavaScript, it's good practice to stay up to date with the latest versions of JavaScript. 

But if you don't feel proficient in JavaScript yet, don't let this hinder you from starting to build with React!
