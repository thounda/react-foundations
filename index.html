    <!--
Component trees

You can keep nesting React components this way to form component trees.

For example, your top-level HomePage component could hold a Header, an Article, and a Footer Component. And each of those components could in turn have their own child components and so on. For example, the Header component could contain a Logo, Title and Navigation component.

This modular format allows you to reuse components in different places inside your app.

In this example, since <HomePage> is now your top-level component, we pass it to the root.render() method instead of the Header component
