# React Foundations

Learn the fundamentals of how user interfaces (UI) are rendered in the browser.

To effectively learn Next.js, it helps to be familiar with JavaScript, React, and related web development concepts.
But JavaScript and React are vast topics. How do you know when you're ready to start using Next.js?

This beginner-friendly, example-led examples will guide you through the prerequisite knowledge for Next.js.
With each branch, we build a simple project step-by-step; starting with a JavaScript application, then migrating it to React and Next.js.

Each section builds on the previous one, so you can choose where to start depending on what you already know from the previous (branch) build.

## Prerequisite knowledge

This repo / set of examples assumes knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and no knowledge of React.

## System requirements

If you will work through the code examples, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js 20.12.0 or later installed.
- Operating systems: macOS, Windows (including WSL), or Linux.
- VSCode or another text editor of your choice.

'HAPPY CODING with React!"
